 An e-commerce company is interested in understanding the customer behavior regarding the shopping. They have already collected the users’ session data for a year. Each row belongs to a different user. The “Made_purchase” is an indicator that whether the user has made a purchase or not during that year. Your client is also interested in predicting that column using other attributes of the users. The client also informs you that the data is collected by non-experts. So, it might have some percentage of error in some columns.
